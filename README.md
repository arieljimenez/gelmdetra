# G**ELM**DETRA
>My 3th attemp to rewrite [Gedetra](https://github.com/frismaury/gedetra) from GAE-Python v2.7 to [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) v0.18

## [ RUNNING THE APP ]
>**`$ sh init.sh`**  and you're ready to **Go** :).
The app will be running in the port **8080.**

## [ REQUISITES ]
- Love for Elm-lang.
- Docker.
- Internet connection for the first run.

## [ TODO ]
- ~Docker image (Alpine with node v9.8.1 will be great)~ _**Alpine 3.6 with nodejs v6.11.3 LTS**_ (btw only weights 60 mb :open_mouth:)
- ~An script.sh to run the environment~ _**init.sh is in the root of the project.**_
- API backend service (preferible a container with Golang and MySQL/MariaDB)
- NGINX or another assets server deliver
- Jenkins container for CI for deployment `&&` webpack for production instructions.
- Docker microservices stack.
- Kubernetes?

## [ Dev Notes ]
From now on the git commit will have the next structure:
- `{new|chg|fix}: [{dev|pkg}:] COMMIT_MESSAGE [!{minor|mayor|refactor}]`

### [ Disclaimer ]
> *This is a **4fun/4learn** project, so don't expect much of it.*
