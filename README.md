# G**ELM**DETRA
>My 3th attemp to rewrite [Gedetra](https://github.com/frismaury/gedetra) from GAE-Python v2.7 to [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) v0.18


## TODO:
- Docker image (Alpine with node 9.8.1 will be great)
- API backend service (preferible a container with Golang and MySQL/MariaDB)
- NGINX or another assets server deliver
- Jenkins container for CI for deployment `&&` webpack for production instructions
- An script.sh to run the environment: Docker cluster images `||` Kubernetes :D

## [ Dev Notes ]
From now on the git commit will have the next structure:
- `{new|chg|fix}: [{dev|pkg}:] COMMIT_MESSAGE [!{minor|mayor|refactor}]`

### [ Disclaimer ]
> *This is a **4fun/4learn** project, so don't expect much of it.*
